Separation of powers means dividing government responsibilities into distinct branches to prevent any one branch from gaining too much power. 
1. Legislature (parliament, congress): **Makes laws**. It represents the people and is typically composed of elected officials who debate and pass laws.
2. Executive (government, president): **Enforces laws**. This branch includes the president or prime minister and their administration, responsible for implementing and executing laws passed by the legislature.
3. Judiciary: Interprets laws. **This branch consists of courts and judges who interpret the law and ensure it is applied fairly**. It resolves disputes and ensures that laws are consistent with the constitution.
Issues like the "democratic deficit" can arise when there's an imbalance of power among these branches, leading to challenges in accountability, representation, and the protection of individual rights.

The document of incorporation typically includes several key components, which may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the type of legal entity being formed. Here are some common elements that may be included in the document:
1. **Name of the Entity**: The document will specify the name of the entity being formed. This name must typically comply with legal requirements, such as uniqueness and not being misleading.
2. **Registered Address**: The document may include the registered address of the entity, which is the official address where legal notices and correspondence will be sent.
3. **Purpose or Object Clause**: This clause outlines the primary purpose or objectives for which the entity is being formed. It may specify the activities or business purposes that the entity is authorized to engage in.
4. **Share Capital or Membership Interests**: For entities with shareholders or members, the document may specify the authorized share capital or membership interests, including the number and types of shares or membership units.
5. **Governance Structure**: The document may outline the governance structure of the entity, including the roles and responsibilities of directors, officers, or other governing bodies.
6. **Rules and Regulations**: It may include rules and regulations governing the internal management and operations of the entity, such as procedures for meetings, decision-making, and voting rights.
7. **Amendment and Dissolution Procedures**: The document may specify procedures for amending the articles of incorporation or for dissolving the entity in the future.
8. **Miscellaneous Provisions**: Other provisions may be included as necessary or required by law, such as indemnification clauses, limitations of liability, or provisions for handling conflicts of interest.
These are just some of the common elements that may be included in the document of incorporation. The specific content and requirements may vary based on the legal framework and regulations applicable to the jurisdiction where the entity is being formed.




The terms "limited liability," "joint liability," "several liability," and "unlimited liability" are all concepts related to the legal responsibility or obligation of individuals or entities. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **Limited Liability**: Limited liability refers to the legal principle that restricts the financial liability of individuals or entities to the amount of their investment or contribution. In the context of business entities, such as corporations or limited liability companies (LLCs), owners or shareholders are typically not personally liable for the debts or obligations of the entity beyond their investment in the company. This means that their personal assets are protected from claims arising from the entity's liabilities.
    
2. **Joint Liability**: Joint liability occurs when multiple parties are held collectively responsible for a debt, obligation, or legal claim. In this scenario, each party is liable for the entire obligation, meaning that the creditor or claimant can pursue any one of the responsible parties for the full amount owed. However, the creditor cannot recover more than the total amount of the debt or claim, regardless of which party they choose to pursue.
    
3. **Several Liability**: Several liability is similar to joint liability, but with one key difference. In several liability, each party is individually responsible only for their portion of the debt or obligation. This means that the creditor or claimant can choose to pursue any one of the responsible parties for their respective share of the total amount owed. If one party pays their share, they are released from further liability, but the creditor can still pursue the remaining parties for their shares.
    
4. **Unlimited Liability**: Unlimited liability refers to the legal obligation of individuals or entities to be personally responsible for all of the debts and obligations of a business or venture. In this scenario, there is no limitation on the liability of the individuals involved, meaning that their personal assets are at risk to satisfy the debts and liabilities of the business. Unlimited liability is often associated with sole proprietorships and general partnerships, where the owners are personally liable for the debts of the business.
    

Overall, these concepts delineate the extent of legal responsibility or obligation for individuals or entities in various contexts, ranging from limited protection of personal assets to full exposure to liability.



The joint and several liability means that the injured party has the option to pursue either the executive officer, the company, or both, to recover the damages. If one party is unable to pay, the other party may be required to compensate for the entire amount.
If the CEO is not able to pay then the company should pay.

"Termination without succession" refers to the dissolution or closure of a legal entity (such as a company or organization) without any continuation or transfer of its rights, obligations, or assets to another entity. In other words, when a legal entity is terminated without succession, it means that the entity ceases to exist entirely, and there is no successor entity to take over its operations or assume its legal standing.


Dear students,

Please, do not forget that the first test is scheduled for April 8, and will start at 10.15 (online through Moodle). You will have 25 questions and 15 minutes. You will have to prepare the first seven slidesÂ for the first test (the rest is for the second test). I have uploaded the textbook. It will help you with the following slides: 1, 6, 7, 8, 8a, 9, 10. Questions will be similar to those in the textbook, no essay questions.

Best regards,

Dr. Zoltan Vig
