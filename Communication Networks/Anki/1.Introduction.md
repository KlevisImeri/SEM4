## Physical Media

What does the host device do when for sending function? #flashcard 
- breaks into smaller chunks, known as packets, of length L bits
<!--ID: 1710369607117-->






What are the names for link transmission rate? #flashcard 
- link transmission rate = link capacity = link bandwidth
<!--ID: 1710369607121-->






What are the types physical media? #flashcard 
- guided media: 
	- signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, coax 
- unguided media: 
	- signals propagate freely, e.g., radio
<!--ID: 1710369607126-->






What can be a Twisted Pair? #flashcard 
- a real twisted pair (old)
- Ethernet
- ADSL
<!--ID: 1710369607131-->






Whare are the types of physical media? #flashcard 
- Coaxial cable
	- two concentric copper conductors
	- bidirectional
	- broadband
- Fiber optic cable
	- expensive

## Network Core

What is the network core? #flashcard 
- mesh of interconnected routers
<!--ID: 1710369607140-->






What i the route or path through the network? #flashcard
A sequence of links and packet switches traversed by the packet through the network from source to destination
<!--ID: 1710369607144-->





What is forwarding=switching? 
What is routing? #flashcard 
local action: move arriving packets from routerâ€™s input link to appropriate router output link. Just read the table.
- Global action: determine source-destination paths taken by packets. There is an algorithm which filles the tables.
![[Pasted image 20240225231642.png|700]]
<!--ID: 1710369607148-->






What does packet switching do? #flashcard 
Store and forward (queuing).
<!--ID: 1710369607152-->







What is the diff between packet and circuit switching? #flashcard 
- Circuit 
	- reserve the whole link capacity for the whole route (no queuing)
	- no sharing
	- like a wire from source to destination
- Packet
	- Just send packets
	- sharing
<!--ID: 1710369607156-->






How can the circuit switching be done? #flashcard

What are the 4 sources of packet delay? #flashcard 
![[Pasted image 20240305213754.png]]
$d_{proc}$ = how much time you need to process
$d_{queue}$ = how much time does it wait at the buffer
$d_{tran}$ = it takes time for all the bits to be pushed into the link L (bits)/R(bps)
$d_{prop}$ = time it takes from one start of link to the end = (d) length of link / (s) speed of propagation
<!--ID: 1710369607173-->






What is throughput? #flashcard 
bits/unit of  ***you need to define the unit of time***
db/dt => instantaneous (rate at a given time)
$\Delta b/\Delta a$ => average (longer period of time)
<!--ID: 1710369607177-->
