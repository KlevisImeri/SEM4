Accessing content
Multicast and unicast are two methods used for transmitting data over computer networks, including the internet. Here's a brief explanation of each:
1. **Unicast**:
   - Unicast is a one-to-one communication method where data is transmitted from a single sender to a single receiver.
   - In a unicast communication, the sender sends a copy of the data packet to each individual receiver, and each receiver receives its own copy of the data.
   - Unicast communication is commonly used for point-to-point communication, such as web browsing, email, file transfers, and video calls, where each communication session involves only two parties.
2. **Multicast**:
   - Multicast is a one-to-many communication method where data is transmitted from a single sender to multiple receivers simultaneously.
   - In a multicast communication, the sender sends a single copy of the data packet, and the network replicates and delivers it to multiple recipients who have subscribed to the multicast group.
   - Multicast communication is efficient for distributing data to multiple recipients who are interested in the same content, such as streaming live video broadcasts, IPTV (Internet Protocol Television), online gaming, and software updates.
In summary, unicast communication involves one sender transmitting data to a single receiver, while multicast communication involves one sender transmitting data to multiple receivers simultaneously. Unicast is used for point-to-point communication, while multicast is used for one-to-many communication.

What is Rendezvous Point (RP)?  Why its needed? #flashcard 
You don't want all the routers to know the whole network (multicast groups). Only let one router to have this information. 
Use RP to sepperate many subnetworks so you don't have scaling issues.
