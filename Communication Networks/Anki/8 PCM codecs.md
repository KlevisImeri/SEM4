What is diff between encoding and line encoding? #flashcard 
- **Encoding**: Encoding the quantized samples into digital data for transmission or storage. This step involves assigning binary codes to the quantized samples to represent them digitally.
- **Line Encoding**: Further encoding the digital data into a format suitable for transmission over communication lines. Line encoding techniques convert digital data into signals that can be transmitted efficiently over communication channels, considering factors such as bandwidth, noise immunity, and clock recovery.

**Tandemizability**:
- Tandemizability refers to the ability of a codec to be used in combination with other codecs in a cascaded manner.
**Recoding**:
- Recoding refers to the process of encoding and decoding data multiple times, either with the same codec or with different codecs, to achieve a desired outcome.
