How in 3G signals are merged together with orthogonal signals. 
$$Sp_1Sp_2=1, Sp_1Sp_1q=0,Sp_2Sp_2q=0$$
$$S_1Sp_1+S_2Sp_2=R$$
$$R*Sp_1=S_1Sp_1Sp_1+S_2Sp_2Sp_1=S_2Sp_2Sp_1 = S_2$$
$$R*Sp_2=S_1Sp_1Sp_2+S_2Sp_2Sp_2=S_1Sp_1Sp_2 = S_1$$
This is with 2 but you can expand it as much as you like. You can think as orthogonal vectors.


3G:
- 5MHz band so less gaps 
- many more channels per tower
- Towers same part of frequency => smooth switch
