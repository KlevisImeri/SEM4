What is Hofstede’s typology? #flashcard 
![[Pasted image 20240319214632.png]]
Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions Theory, developed by Geert Hofstede, is a framework used to understand the differences in culture across countries. It was initially developed based on a survey conducted by IBM between 1967 and 1973, which aimed to understand the differences in values among employees in different countries. The theory has since been refined and expanded to include six key dimensions:
1. **Power Distance Index (PDI)**: This dimension measures the extent to which less powerful members of institutions and organizations accept that power is distributed unequally.
2. **Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV)**: It measures the degree to which individuals are integrated into groups.
3. **Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS)**: This dimension reflects the distribution of roles between the genders.
4. **Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI)**: It measures the extent to which people feel uncomfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity.
5. **Long-term Orientation vs. Short-term Normative Orientation (LTO)**: This dimension reflects the extent to which people in a society are oriented towards the future or the past.
6. **Indulgence vs. Restraint (IVR)**: It measures the extent to which people in a society feel that it is acceptable to seek gratification and enjoy life.
These dimensions help in understanding how cultures differ in their values, which in turn influences behavior, communication, and business practices. For example, in cultures with a high power distance, there is a greater acceptance of hierarchical structures, whereas in cultures with low power distance, there is a greater emphasis on equality. Similarly, in collectivist cultures, people are more likely to prioritize group goals over individual goals, while in individualist cultures, the opposite is true.
Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions Theory has been widely used in various fields, including cross-cultural psychology, international management, and cross-cultural communication, to understand and navigate cultural differences. It provides insights into how people from different cultures interact, communicate, and make decisions, which is crucial in international business and diplomacy
