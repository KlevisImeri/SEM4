What are divisions? #flashcard 
Divisions (formed and operating as a smaller company within the real company) enclose a complete set of functions, like having their own accounting, sales or HR. Divisions can be specified by product, market or geographic area too. 
<!--ID: 1708890263830-->


The independence of divisions may vary. So what kind of divisions do we distinguish by this? #flashcard 
- ***cost centers*** (costs can be traced or segregated to the division and the head of a cost centre will be responsible for the costs only: not revenue or profits); 
- ***profit centers*** (both costs and revenues are identified in the division and the head of the profit center will also be responsible for revenues, not just costs); 
- ***investment centers*** (costs, revenues and also capital investment are identified in the division and the head of the investment center will be responsible for costs, revenues, and capital expenditure (all financial aspects))

Explain the ***divisional form*** with the properties we learn for organizational structure? #flashcard 
- Division of labor: multi-dimensional -> according to products, customers or regions
- Authority: one- or multi-line -> decentralized decisions between the central unit and the divisions, centralized within the divisions
- Coordination: technocratic  tools; horizontally hardly among the divisions
- Advantages: big independency, motivation is important, strategic  and operational tasks are separated
- Disadvantages: parallel existing functional organizations, increased  number of staff, divisions became selfish
- Application: dynamic environment, a wide range of products

- Division of labor: multi-dimensionalhorizontally functional (technical, sales, etc.),  vertically products or projects
- Authority: multi-line; functional and project leaders making the  decisions together, decentralized decisions, decisions are not highly  regulated
- Coordination: employee-oriented tools; horizontally and vertically because of the structure
- Advantages: dynamic and flexible structure, good studying process  at problem handlings, mixed structure, accommodate to the  challenges
- Disadvantages: two-line management (possible competition among functional and productional manager), competition among the managers, nobody dares to take the responsibility for the decisions
