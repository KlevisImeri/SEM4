- They made me lonely
- I was addicted ( i wasn't eating all day and I wasn't doing my human needs)
- Damaging my health (eyes and body)
- ***Didn't make me happy***
- I don't want it to be my profession
- I have no income no money. I live in my hands of my parents
- I was not finishing my duties at faculty or overall
- I was an egoist
- There are so many other problems in life that needs to be solve and being good at the game is not one
- I am throwing down the trust of people who believe in me
- I have to be good at something so I choose to be good at programing and helping solve real problems
- It doesn't make me real friends or people
- They give no meaning in life (Is being good in a game really what life is) NO, NO, NO
- Life is not about things you want to doing the thing that you think is the right thing to do
- It doesn't make me a person people can believe on
- It doesn't make me a clear soul
This is my conclusion why video games are bad.

>- Sleep and wale op on time
>- Eat healthy and take care of myself
