Hello team,

From tomorrow we will have a different approach to the way we solve the problem in the project lab.
What we will do is that immediately on Friday after we get home we join discord. The lectures finished at 12:00. Around ***1:00 to 1:30*** you should be able to join. If not please give a reason why (if you have other classes it's okay), so we can discuss how we can make the schedule better. (Don't take it like I am the boss here.)

> The main ideas is that we will work together for each part and not spread apart, therefore we will go line by line with each other so there are not any discrepancies between our parts. According to the analysis I have done is that everyone has a different way of approaching the problem and therefore the parts are not flowing well together. Someone says `this` and below it says `that` (something else).

> [!warning]
>We will stay on discord and discuss every line we do. 

Everyone will have the docs open and we will discuss in discord while we work together in one part. 
#### The reasons of this are:
- Everyone understand each other
- Everyone gives his own ideas at each part
- Everyone participates nearly the same

We will work all Friday and Saturday till we finish. It we be nice if we all wake up at the same time on Saturday, but this is open for discussion.

I think this is better for everyone!

If you have anything you don't like ***please express yourself***.
