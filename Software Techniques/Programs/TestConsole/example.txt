Make a Console application "Hot potato" based on the following instructions. Hot potato is a party game with players sitting in a circle and pass a potato to their right-side neighbor. Once the time runs out, whoever has the potato loses the game.
 
Multithreading (minimum points: 13)
The application's main thread selects a random, integer between 5 and 21. This will be the game in seconds. After this, it should start 100 worker threads named Player1, Player2,..., Player100. Then the main thread starts the game.
When the game starts, Player1 has the potato. When a worker thread has the potato, it waits for 100ms before passing it to the next thread (Player 1 passes it to Player2, ..., Player100 passes it to Player1). Players that don't have the potato should wait for their turn efficiently.
The main thread prints out the name of the thread that has the potato every 10ms. Be accurate, always print the name of the potato holder at that exact time.
