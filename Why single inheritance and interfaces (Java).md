Let's suppose you only want to use interfaces in a whole project (That means no inheritance). What problems would you have along the way? Lest call structures as objects only containing data but no functions. 1. The fist problem i would say is, well, if you only use interfaces how would you reuse the structures (the ones we define above). 2. ... Can you list any other problems with only using?

Ides of Solutions for problem 1: (I may be wrong, so take my words with a grain of salt) Lets call interfaces "FuncInterfaces". For the first problem maybe decouple the data and have "DataInterfaces" (similar to structures defined above). So you can make the class out of "DataInterfaces" and "FuncInterfaces". There is a slight problem here, what about virtual function that you implement once and you reuse? Maybe you can make "FucnInterfaces" implement that function but you will need the data for that. So make "FucnInterfaces" which require "DataInterfaces". This is the same as classes which have virtual methods on them. Furthermore, Implementing {"FucnInterfaces" which require "DataInterfaces"} is the same as inheriting. So if you want to implemented virtual methods you will need inheritance either way (This conslusiont of mine may be very wrong though). So then why don't we only have object which inherit from each other (like c++)? We tried to decouple everything (like C) and lost some reusability of the code (the implemented virtual functions) so why don't package them together (like C++)? Why only use single inheritance? My guess it to avoid the diamond problem, but probably is trying to fix other problems. What are these other problem or is it just a choice of simplicity? So as a conclusion, to increase reusability we use inheritance and to increase decoupling we use interfaces. In this aspect the Java design seems as balanced in the middle,
